  <h1>Melee Combat System</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      A focused melee combat prototype demonstrating animation-driven attacks, combat state management, 
      directional blocking, dodge mechanics with animation-synchronized invulnerability frames, guard break interactions, 
      and a modular ability system with resource management in a multiplayer environment.

    <h2>Core Systems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4-hit light attack combos with animation-synchronized hit windows</li>
      <li>Stamina, health, and mana systems with action-based drain/regeneration</li>
      <li>Directional dodging and blocking with i-frames and stamina tracking</li>
      <li>Guard break mechanics and enemy hit/death reactions</li>
      <li>Modular ability system integrated with combat states, cooldowns, and resource costs</li>
      <li>Server-authoritative hit detection, ability validation, and dodge/block logic</li>
      <li>Enemy AI using finite state machines for behaviors and reactions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Animation & Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Combat actions, dodge frames, and guard break reactions are synchronized with animations 
      to ensure accurate hit detection and smooth state transitions. The architecture is transferable 
      to 3D environments and engines like Unity or C++ projects.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Event & Progression System</h2>
    <p>
      A modular system tracks player/enemy states, quest flags, and world interactions. It enables 
      seamless integration of new content without altering core combat logic.

    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Preventing exploits:</strong> Server-side validation ensures attacks, abilities, dodges, and blocks follow combat rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Responsive abilities:</strong> Input buffering, state machine constraints, and resource gating maintain responsiveness while preventing unintended cancels.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Expanded enemy AI and behavior complexity</li>
      <li>Enhanced animation blending and keyframe transitions</li>
      <li>Additional resource-based abilities and combo-heavy attack variations</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I learned how to design a combat system that feels responsive without sacrificing server authority or fairness.</li>
      <li>I gained experience integrating animation events with gameplay logic to synchronize attacks, dodges, and guard breaks.</li>
      <li>I understood the importance of modular systems for abilities, AI, and event handling for future scalability.</li>
      <li>Balancing resources like stamina and mana requires careful tuning and playtesting to make gameplay engaging and strategic.</li>
      <li>Debugging multiplayer interactions taught me the value of testing and thinking about edge cases for exploits and animation desyncs.</li>
    </ul>
