# Cameron Richardson – Game Development Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal game development portfolio site, built using GitHub Pages.
It showcases selected systems, prototypes, and technical work focused on gameplay programming,
combat systems, and game mechanics.

**Live Site:** https://camsr003.github.io/

---

## Overview

This portfolio highlights my experience designing and implementing gameplay systems,
with a focus on:

- Combat systems and character control
- State-driven gameplay logic
- Resource-based mechanics (stamina, mana, cooldowns)
- Animation-synchronized gameplay events
- Modular, scalable system design

Most showcased projects are prototypes or internal builds that demonstrate system-level
thinking rather than polished commercial releases.

## Featured Projects

### Melee Combat System
A modular melee combat prototype designed to demonstrate animation-driven combat logic,
server-authoritative validation, and extensible mechanics.

**Key systems include:**
- Combo-based light attacks with input buffering
- Directional blocking with stamina-based guard and guard breaks
- Dodge mechanics with animation-synchronized invulnerability frames
- Heavy attacks that break guard states
- Integrated ability system with mana costs and cooldowns
- Enemy AI using finite state machines
- Server-side validation to prevent exploit damage

Project breakdown available on the site.

### Pirates of the Cannonean
A data visualization web project built using Python Flask that explores global maritime
pirate attacks through interactive maps and charts.

**My responsibilities included:**
- UI design and layout
- Data presentation and visualization structure

## Technical Focus

While this site is built with HTML/CSS, the showcased projects emphasize transferable
game development skills applicable to C++, Unity, and other 3D engines:

- Gameplay state machines
- Animation-event-driven logic
- Resource and cooldown management
- Event/flag-based progression systems
- Multiplayer-safe validation patterns

## About the Portfolio

Some projects shown here (especially Roblox-based systems) are not publicly available
as source repositories. Instead, this portfolio focuses on:

- System design explanations
- Feature breakdowns
- Gameplay demonstrations
- Technical decision-making

This approach mirrors professional game development workflows where internal tools
and prototypes are not publicly distributed.
