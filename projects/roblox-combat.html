  <h1>Melee Combat System Prototype (Roblox)</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      A focused melee combat prototype built to demonstrate animation-driven attacks,
      combat state management, directional blocking, dodge mechanics with animation-synchronized
      invulnerability frames, guard break interactions, and a modular ability system with
      mana/resource management in a multiplayer environment.

    <h2>Demo</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Replace with YouTube embed -->
      <em>Gameplay video coming soon</em>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Core Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4-hit light attack combo system with animation-synchronized hit windows</li>
      <li>Stamina, health, and mana systems with action-based drain and regeneration</li>
      <li>Directional dodging with i-frames validated on the server</li>
      <li>Enemy hit reactions, guard break states, and death sequences</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Systems Breakdown</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Combat state machine (Idle, Attacking, Recovery, Ability Use)</li>
      <li>Combo input buffering and reset timing for responsive attack chains</li>
      <li>Server-authoritative hit detection and ability validation to prevent exploits</li>
      <li>Enemy AI using finite state machine logic for behavior and reactions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Extended Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Directional blocking system with stamina-based damage mitigation and guard stamina tracking
      </li>
      <li>
        Heavy attacks that apply increased stamina damage to blocking targets and trigger
        guard break states when block stamina is depleted
      </li>
      <li>
        Guard break transitions enemies into vulnerable reaction states, enabling follow-up attacks
      </li>
      <li>
        Dodge mechanic with animation-synchronized invulnerability frames (i-frames), stamina cost, 
        and recovery timing
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Ability System Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Implemented a modular ability system designed to integrate directly with the core
      combat framework, allowing abilities to interact with combat states, stamina, 
      mana costs, cooldowns, and enemy reactions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Abilities define activation conditions, resource cost, cooldown, and combat state transitions</li>
      <li>Activation is validated against combat state, stamina/mana availability, and cooldown timers</li>
      <li>Abilities can modify damage behavior, movement, or trigger enemy reactions</li>
      <li>Mana regeneration and ability lockout prevent ability spam and invalid overlaps</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Event and Progression System</h2>
    <p>
      Implemented a modular event management system to track player and enemy states, 
      flags for quests or scripted sequences, and interactions between player abilities 
      and world events. This system allows seamless integration of new content without modifying
      core combat logic.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Animation Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Combat actions, dodge frames, and guard break reactions are synchronized with animation
      events to ensure accurate hit detection and state transitions. The system is designed
      to be transferable to 3D environments with keyframe-based animations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Roblox Lua (client/server separation, modular script architecture)</li>
      <li>RemoteEvents for secure combat and ability replication</li>
      <li>State machines for combat, abilities, and enemy AI</li>
      <li>Server validation for hit detection, ability execution, and dodge/block logic to prevent exploits</li>
      <li>Designed with transferable architecture suitable for C++ or Unity 3D implementations</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Preventing players from applying damage or bypassing combat 
      rules through spoofed client events.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented server-side validation for attacks, abilities, 
      dodge, and block/guard break states synchronized with animation events.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Ensuring abilities and dodge mechanics feel responsive without 
      allowing unintended animation cancel exploits.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Input buffering, state machine constraints, and resource 
      gating (stamina/mana) maintain responsiveness while enforcing valid transitions.
    </p>

    <h2>What I’d Improve Next</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Expanded enemy behaviors and AI complexity</li>
      <li>Enhanced animation blending and keyframe transitions</li>
      <li>Additional resource-based abilities and combo-heavy attack variations</li>
    </ul>
