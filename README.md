# Cameron Richardson – Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio site, built using GitHub Pages.
It showcases selected systems, prototypes, technical work focused on gameplay programming and game mechanics, and other programming related projects.

**Live Site:** https://camsr003.github.io/

## Overview

This portfolio highlights my experience designing and implementing gameplay systems as well as other projects.

Most showcased projects are prototypes or internal builds that demonstrate system-level
thinking rather than polished commercial releases.

---

## Technical Focus

While this site is built with HTML/CSS, the showcased projects emphasize transferable
game development skills applicable to C++, Unity, and other 3D engines.
