    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      "Stranger World" is an open-world roleplay game playable on Roblox, a game based on the Netflix show "Stranger Things". 
      This project involved contributing to a game with a somewhat established codebase. 
      I was responsible for integrating new gameplay mechanics alongside UI and backend systems, which required rewiring and refactoring existing logic to support new interactions, data flow, and player states.

  <section>
    <h2>Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed and implemented new UI logic that integrated with existing backend systems</li>
      <li>Rewired and extended legacy code to support new mechanic-driven behaviors and state changes</li>
      <li>Integrated and adapted free-to-use, open-source modules to fit the game’s architecture and design constraints</li>
      <li>Refactored portions of existing systems to improve compatibility, readability, and maintainability</li>
      <li>Ensured new mechanics worked seamlessly with pre-existing progression, data storage, and event systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Existing systems were not originally designed with these new mechanics in mind, 
            making direct implementation risky without breaking existing functionality:</strong>
             I analyzed how current systems handled player state, events, and data flow, then extended those systems rather than replacing them. 
             This allowed new mechanics to plug into established logic while preserving stability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-party modules did not always align with the game’s existing architecture:</strong> I isolated external modules and modified their interfaces where necessary, allowing them to integrate cleanly without leaking implementation details into core systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enemy attack coordination:</strong> Implemented an "Attack Queue" module that tells the NPC when it is their turn to attack, creating less combat pressure for the player.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Further modularize gameplay mechanics to improve reuse and scalability</li>
      <li>Adding debug tools and visualizers</li>
      <li>Making more user-friendly mechanics to boost accessibility</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned how to safely introduce new gameplay mechanics into an existing production codebase</li>
      <li>Improved ability to reason about and modify legacy systems without destabilizing them</li>
      <li>Gained experience coordinating gameplay, backend, and UI logic across multiple systems</li>
      <li>Developed stronger judgment around when to refactor versus extend existing code</li>
      <li>Reinforced the importance of architectural consistency in collaborative game development</li>
    </ul>
