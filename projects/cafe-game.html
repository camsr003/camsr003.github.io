  <h1>Yokai Cafe</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Yokai Cafe</strong> is a first-person horror café game where players juggle normal work tasks while something feels increasingly wrong.
      The game is structured around a full workday using a phase-based system (opening, serving, closing) that controls pacing, progression,
      and when unsettling events can occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s built with a modular, data-driven approach using <strong>ScriptableObjects</strong>, making it easy to iterate on systems,
      add new mechanics, and experiment with horror elements layered on top of everyday gameplay.

    <h2>Core Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Phase-Based Gameplay Loop:</strong>
        The café day is split into opening, serving, and closing phases, which control available interactions and help pace both gameplay and horror.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customer Ordering System:</strong>
        Customers place randomized orders that the player must prepare and deliver correctly to keep the café running.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interaction System:</strong>
        A unified system for interacting with doors, light switches, items, and other world objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Item Behavior System:</strong>
        Items perform context-specific actions when used, allowing new items to be added without rewriting core logic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ScriptableObject-Driven Design:</strong>
        Data and behavior are separated to keep systems flexible, reusable, and easy to iterate on.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Keeping systems manageable as scope grew</strong><br>
      → Solved by separating data and logic using ScriptableObjects, reducing hard-coded behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Managing gameplay flow across different phases</strong><br>
      → Built a centralized phase manager to handle transitions and avoid scattered state checks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Making routine tasks feel tense instead of repetitive</strong><br>
      → Designed core mechanics to support horror events without interrupting normal gameplay flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>More horror events tied to specific phases</li>
      <li>Deeper customer behaviors and order variations</li>
      <li>Persistent consequences for player mistakes</li>
      <li>Dynamic lighting and audio systems</li>
      <li>Save/load support and difficulty tuning</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>System-driven design makes iteration faster and safer</li>
      <li>Separating data from logic helps projects scale cleanly</li>
      <li>Horror works best when layered onto familiar mechanics</li>
      <li>Strong foundations early make future features easier to add</li>
