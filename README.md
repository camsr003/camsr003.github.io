# Cameron Richardson – Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio site, built using GitHub Pages.
It showcases selected systems, prototypes, and other programming related projects.

**Live Site:** https://camsr003.github.io/

## Note

Most showcased projects are prototypes or internal builds that demonstrate system-level
thinking rather than polished commercial releases. Showcased projects emphasize transferable
game development skills applicable to C++, Unity, and other 3D engines.
