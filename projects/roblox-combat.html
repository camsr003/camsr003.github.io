  <h1>Melee Combat System Prototype (Roblox)</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      A focused melee combat prototype built to demonstrate animation-driven attacks,
      combat state management, blocking with stamina-based damage mitigation,
      directional dodging with animation-synchronized invulnerability frames,
      and integrated ability usage in a multiplayer environment.

    <h2>Core Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4-hit light attack combo system</li>
      <li>Animation-based hit windows</li>
      <li>Stamina, health, and mana systems with action-based drain and regeneration</li>
      <li>Enemy hit reactions and death</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Systems Breakdown</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Combat state machine (Idle, Attacking, Recovery)</li>
      <li>Combo input buffering and reset timing</li>
      <li>Server-authoritative hit detection</li>
      <li>Enemy AI using finite state machine logic</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Extended Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Directional blocking system with stamina-based damage mitigation and guard stamina tracking
      </li>
      <li>
        Heavy attacks that deal increased block stamina damage and trigger guard break states
        when block stamina is depleted
      </li>
      <li>
        Guard break transitions enemies into vulnerable reaction states, enabling follow-up attacks
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Ability System Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Implemented a modular ability system designed to integrate directly with the core
      combat framework, allowing abilities to interact with combat states, stamina,
      mana costs, cooldowns, and enemy reactions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Abilities define activation conditions, mana cost, cooldown, and combat state transitions</li>
      <li>Ability activation is validated against current combat state and available resources</li>
      <li>Abilities can modify damage behavior, apply movement overrides, or trigger enemy reaction states</li>
      <li>Mana regeneration and ability lockout prevent ability spam and invalid overlaps</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Roblox Lua (client/server separation)</li>
      <li>RemoteEvents for combat replication</li>
      <li>Modular script architecture</li>
      <li>Server validation to prevent exploit damage</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Preventing players from applying damage
      through spoofed client events.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Server validates attack state, timing window,
      and hit results before applying damage.
    </p>

    <h2>What I’d Improve Next</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Expanded enemy behaviors</li>
      <li>Improved animation blending</li>
    </ul>
